# CoFI

This is a PUBLICLY viewable repository (though currently we control who can commit to it). Be aware of that if you are putting stuff in.
I set it up this way because that is where I understood we wanted to end up, so start as you mean to go on I say.

This will be the initial skeleton/demonstration-of-concept for CoFI
