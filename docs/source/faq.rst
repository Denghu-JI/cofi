Can I use CoFI to run my inversion in parallel if the selected tool allows that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can run your inversion in parallel using exactly the same ways as are 
described in the tool's own documentation.

Take ``emcee`` as an example, you can use CoFI to run a sampling process in parallel with
exactly the same way as described in
`their documentation <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/parallel/>`_. Click 
`here <https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi-examples/blob/main/examples/more_scripts/emcee_parallel_good_practice.py>`_
for an example adapted from their documentation.
