    "\n",
    "But we would like users of CoFI to be able to come along with their own forward problem, and by doing as little as work as possible (ideally, just writing a yml file), be able to use CoFI. This notebook steps through that process, starting from the point of view of a user that has ONLY downloaded CoFI, and wants to use it to help solve/sample their forward problem.\n"
